// Mini Challenge 5-7 Endpoints MVC

// Design an API with 4 endpoints based on mini challenges from the Combine:

You may have multiple controllers inside a Controller folder, or you can have multiple endpoints in a single controller in a Controller folder.
Validation is required. If a mathematical endpoint is provided a string or other invalid data, your endpoint should have a response prepared for it. 

Endpoints:
1. MadLib: create an endpoint that accepts multiple inputs.  Output should be a story based on those values.

2. OddOrEven: create an endpoint that displays if a number entered is odd or even.

3. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters then reverses them.  For example:
     - "You entered 123ABC, reversed is CBA321"

4. ReverseIt (Numbers Only): endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and reverses them.  Be sure to display the original characters before the reversed.  For example:
     - "You entered 12345, reversed is 54321"
